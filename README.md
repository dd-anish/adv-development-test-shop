# Adventure Store Theme 


## Getting started
We recommend using Dawn as a starting point for theme development. [Learn more on Shopify.dev](https://shopify.dev/themes/getting-started/create).

> If you're building a theme for the Shopify Theme Store, then you can use Dawn as a starting point. However, the theme that you submit needs to be [substantively different from Dawn](https://shopify.dev/themes/store/requirements#uniqueness) so that it provides added value for merchants. Learn about the [ways that you can use Dawn](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/dawn#ways-to-use-dawn).

Please note that the main branch may include code for features not yet released. The "stable" version of Dawn is available in the theme store.

## Staying up to date with Dawn changes

Say you're building a new theme off Dawn but you still want to be able to pull in the latest changes, you can add a remote `upstream` pointing to this Dawn repository.

1. Navigate to your local theme folder.
2. Verify the list of remotes and validate that you have both an `origin` and `upstream`:
```sh
git remote -v
```
3. If you don't see an `upstream`, you can add one that points to Shopify's Dawn repository:
```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Shopify/dawn.git
```
4. Pull in the latest Dawn changes into your repository:
```sh
git fetch upstream
git pull upstream main
```

### Start the Theme with CLI

`shopify theme dev --store adventure-store-test-shop`


### Theme Check

We recommend using [Theme Check](https://github.com/shopify/theme-check) as a way to validate and lint your Shopify themes.

We've added Theme Check to Dawn's [list of VS Code extensions](/.vscode/extensions.json) so if you're using Visual Studio Code as your code editor of choice, you'll be prompted to install the [Theme Check VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.theme-check-vscode) extension upon opening VS Code after you've forked and cloned Dawn.

You can also run it from a terminal with the following Shopify CLI command:

```bash
shopify theme check
```

#### Shopify/lighthouse-ci-action

We love fast websites! Which is why we created [Shopify/lighthouse-ci-action](https://github.com/Shopify/lighthouse-ci-action). This runs a series of [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) audits for the home, product and collections pages on a store to ensure code that gets added doesn't degrade storefront performance over time.
